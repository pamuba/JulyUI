Redux is predictable state container for JS  applications
Redux is not tied to react
Can be used with Angular, Vue, JS
Redux is a lib for JS applicaions

**state of the application can change
todo ->(item-pending)->(item-done)

all state transitions are explicit and we can also track them
above makes the application staet predictable

3 CORE concepts:
Store - Cake shop
Action - describes the action  INTENTION to BUY_CAKE
Reducer - shopkeeper(ties the store and the action)

Store - a store holds the state of ur applicaion
reducer - actuaaly carries out th state transitions dependening on the action


3 PRINCIPALS
1. The state of ur application is stored in an object tree within the single store
2. The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object that describes the action 
3. to specify how the store tree changes , we write pure reducers

Redux Store
1. Holds app state
2. Allows access to state via getState()
3. Allows state to be updated vis dispatch(action)
4. Register listeners via subscribe(listener)
5. Hanldle unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener)
